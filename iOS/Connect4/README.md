# Connect4


Final assignment for **CocaoTouch App Development** module to build an iOS game to play Connect4 also known as 4-in-a-Row. Connect4 is a two player connection game in which players first pick a colour (red or yellow), and then take turns dropping a coloured disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one’s own discs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

The game is played against a deep learning bot, called α-C4, trained to play Connect4, It is packaged into an iOS framework (credit Guenole Silvestre - UCD) called Alpha0Connect4. The task was to build a responsive, dynamic user interface for the game so that a user can play against α-C4.

The description of this assignment was intentionally vague so that students could express their creativity both in terms of programming skills and UI design. 

Below are some screenshots of Connect4:
