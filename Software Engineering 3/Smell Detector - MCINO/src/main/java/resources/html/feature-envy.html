<h2>What is a Feature Envy smell?</h2>
A method accesses the data of another object more than its own data.

<h2>How can we treat feature envy?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If it is obvious that a method should be moved to another place, use Move Method.</li>
    <li>Use Extract method to move the part in question if only a part of a method has access to the data of another object.</li>
    <li>If a method uses functions from several other classes, first determine which class contains most of the data used. Then place the method in this class along with the other data. Alternatively, use Extract Method to split the method into several parts that can be placed in different places in different classes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why bother?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Less code duplication.</li>
    <li>Better code organization.</li>
</ul>
