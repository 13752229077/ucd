<h2>What is a Lazy Class smell?</h2>
When a class doesn't do enough, or doesn't do anything at all.


<h2>How can we treat a lazy class?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>For components that are useless or near useless we should consider removing them or giving them the inline class treatment or using Collapse Hierarchy for subclasses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why bother?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Overall code size is reduced.</li>
    <li>Maintenance of code will be easier.</li>
</ul>
