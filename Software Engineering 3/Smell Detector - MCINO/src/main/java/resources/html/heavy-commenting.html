<h2>What is a Heavy Commenting smell?</h2>
When your program is filled with self explanatory comments.

<h2>How can we treat heavy commenting?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use Extract Variable to split comments that describe complex expressions into subexpressions.</li>
    <li>Instead of explaining a method, give it a self explanatory name you can use Rename Method for this.</li>
    <li>To assert rules about a certain state that is needed for the system to work use Introduce Assertion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why bother?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Code becomes more obvious and easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
