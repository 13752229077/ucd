<h2>What is a Long Method smell?</h2>
A method contains too many lines of code.

<h2>How can we treat a long method?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>An extract method can be used to reduce the size of a method.</li>
    <li>If local variables and parameters interfere with extracting a method, use Replace Temp with Query, Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object.</li>
    <li>We can move the entire method into a separate object.</li>
    <li>If methods have a lot of conditional loops and operators then code can more than likely be moved to a different method, we can use Decompose Conditional to do this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why bother?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The shorter and more concise a method is the easier it is to maintain,understand and work on in the future.</li>
    <li>Duplicated code is more often than not found in long methods.</li>
</ul>
