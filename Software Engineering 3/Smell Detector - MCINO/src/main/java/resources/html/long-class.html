<h2>What is a Long Class smell?</h2>
When a class contains many fields/methods/lines of code.

<h2>How can we treat a long class?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use an extract class if parts of the code can be placed in a separate class..</li>
    <li>An Extract Interface can be useful if itâ€™s necessary to have a list of the operations and behaviors that the client can use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why bother?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Shorter classes tend to be loosely coupled and highly cohesive and this is what we want to achieve.</li>
    <li>Splitting up classes can help developers to avoid duplication of code.</li>
</ul>
